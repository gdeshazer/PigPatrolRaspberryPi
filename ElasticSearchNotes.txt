Elastisearch Notes
    Elastisearch is stored within its own folder
        works along side kibana, and logstash
    Logstash
        Manages the log files
        has a filter which scans the files

        start logstash from dirrectory it lives in with bin/logstash -f pigpatrol.conf

        filter used for this projet stored under Documents/logstash*/pigpatrol.conf

            input{
              file{
                path => "/Users/grantdeshazer/Desktop/LogFiles/*.log"
                start_position=>beginning
                ignore_older=>0
                sincedb_path=>"/dev/null"
              }
            }

            filter{
              grok{
                 match => { "message" => "%{NUMBER:Sensor1:float}\t%{NUMBER:Sensor2:float}\t%{NUMBER:Sensor3:float}\t%{NUMBER:Sensor4:float}\t%{NUMBER:TimeStamp:float}"}
              }
            }

            output{
              elasticsearch{
            	hosts=> ["localhost:9200"]
              }
              stdout{}
            }

        grok is the filter
            the NUMBER:sensor1:float, identifies the numbers in the line, names them, and marks them as floats
        Output dirrects the outputs from the logstash to elasticsearch
            elasticsearch has an open port under 9200
    Kibana is a web page that takes data from elasticsearch and makes it look pretty in html gui
        lives in Documents/kibana.*/
