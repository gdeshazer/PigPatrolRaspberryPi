Elastisearch Notes
    Elastisearch is stored within its own folder
        works along side kibana, and logstash
    Kopf
        Web browser based manager for elastisearch
        installed with command:  elasticsearch-2.4.0/bin/plugin install lmenezes/elasticsearch-kopf/{2.0/x2.1.1}

    Logstash
        Manages the log files
        has a filter which scans the files

        start logstash from dirrectory it lives in with bin/logstash -f pigpatrol.conf

        filter used for this projet stored under Documents/logstash*/pigpatrol.conf

            input{
              file{
                path => "/Users/grantdeshazer/Desktop/LogFiles/*.log"
                start_position=>beginning
                ignore_older=>0
                sincedb_path=>"/dev/null"
              }
            }

            filter{
              grok{
                 match => { "message" => "%{NUMBER:Sensor1:float}\t%{NUMBER:Sensor2:float}\t%{NUMBER:Sensor3:float}\t%{NUMBER:Sensor4:float}\t%{NUMBER:TimeStamp:float}"}
              }
            }

            output{
              elasticsearch{
            	hosts=> ["localhost:9200"]
              }
              stdout{}
            }

        grok is the filter plugin (comes installed with elastisearch)
            the NUMBER:sensor1:float, identifies the numbers in the line, names them, and marks them as floats
        Output dirrects the outputs from the logstash to elasticsearch
            elasticsearch has an open port under 9200

    Kibana is a web page that takes data from elasticsearch and makes it look pretty in html gui
        lives in Documents/kibana.*/
        When started will print out the server ip that value is being broadcast to
            to get to the web browser version go to http://127.0.0.1:5061
            or http://0.0.0.1:5061


        Graph is made in visualize tab
            search for Sensor#:[0 TO 1000]  ~> Search for values rather than range
                range is determined by when the file is entered
            X metric
                Term              :  TimeStamp
                descending order  :  range 2000
            Y Metric
                Term   :  Sensor#
                Metric :  Max
