## Pig Patrol Raspberry Pi Data Logger

Raspberry Pi I2C implementation for Arduino communication and data logging.

Currently this takes data sent through the I2C line and stores the data in a flat file generated by java's built in
logger.  The raw data is stored with a time stamp.

Data collected from an I2C device is then stored in a specified directory.  This directory can be changed to fit
what ever is necessary.  Each data log file should be limited to a size of 50Mb and new files will automatically be
generated when they reach the maximum size.

The Arduino code that is used alongside this can be found [here](https://github.com/gdeshazer/Arduino-Capacitive-Sensor).

## Future Changes

- Start and stop data collection with button press rather than launching the jar.
- Include start up script to be installed on Raspberry Pi to start java app when the Raspberry Pi is powered on.
- Expand returned float array to accommodate more sensors.

## Project Goal

This project aims to test how effective inductive sensors are at detecting changes within a metal surface.
Based on the results the sensors would then be included on a pipeline inspection robot to find defects on the inside of a
pipe.
