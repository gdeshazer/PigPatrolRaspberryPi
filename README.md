## Pig Patrol Raspberry Pi Data Logger

Raspberry Pi I2C implementation for Arduino communication and data logging.

Currently this takes data sent through the I2C line and stores the data in a flat file generated by java's built in
logger.  The raw data is stored with a time stamp.

Data collected from an I2C device is then stored in a specified directory.  This directory can be changed to fit
what ever is necessary.  Each data log file should be limited to a size of 50Mb and new files will automatically be
generated when they reach the maximum size.  No more than 10 data files will be generated.  This number can be changed
as necessary, along with the overall file size.

The program now has a toggle function to start and stop data logging via a momentary push button.  The button allows
for the user to control when data is being logged without having to be remote shelled into the Rasberry Pi.

The Arduino code that is used alongside this can be found [here](https://github.com/gdeshazer/Arduino-Capacitive-Sensor).

## Future Changes

* Expand returned byte array to accommodate more sensors.
